### Blogs page

The Blogs Page retains the same header, navbar and footer from the home page. The About Page was the only one that looks different from the other pages on this website.

There is a small title that says "Welcome to my blogs" in capitals. My first article is titled 'Basic Coding html'. This title is located under the first article's image. Some placeholder text has been added underneath. If you click this first image, it will take you to an external website 'W3School Basic HTML'.

The next image is titled 'web development' and the layout is the same as the one previously. When you click on this image it takes you to an external website 'Wikipedia' with an entry on Web Development.

The next image is titled 'CSS Basics'. Same layout as before.When you click on this image it takes you to an external website 'W3School' with an entry on CSS Basics.

Next image is titled 'App Development'. Same layout. When you click the image it takes you to an external website ' Wikipadeia' with an entry on App Development.

The final image is titled 'Game Development'. Same deal. When you click the image it takes you to an external website 'wikipedia, with an entry on Game Development.

A picture of the Blog Page is below:

### Gallery Page

The Gallery Page retains the same header, navbar and footer from the home page. The gallery contains five images displayed in rows. The first three images contain code to create the colourwheel seen in the fourth image. The last photo is just a silly one for giggles.

A photo of the gallery can be seen below:
